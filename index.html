            <h3>Why BSc Creative Media?</h3>
            <p>
                The Bachelor of Science in Creative Media (BScCM) is a multidisciplinary programme that integrates art, technology, and media. Our programme delivers interdisciplinary teaching by crossing the boundaries among digital media, design, and computer science, which bridges creative and technical sides of computer-based media art production. Students will be trained in computer graphics, digital imaging, mobile media, user-interface (UI) and user-experience (UX) design, computer games and interactive media.
